This GitHub repository hosts the Java project for Oasis Infobyte's Digital Library Management.

This Java code implements a digital library management system with features for both admin and user functionalities. It utilizes HashMaps to store book details and user login credentials. The system allows admins to add, update, and delete books, while users can view, borrow, and return books. The program includes interactive console-based menus for navigation and user interaction. Additionally, it manages book issuance to prevent multiple simultaneous borrowings by a single user.
